\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This thesis examines different methodologies and designs that aim to realize the idea of emulating seL4 in Linux. This report will mainly focus on reviewing the related projects. The first three are QEMU, Cygwin, and Wine, which provide solutions to run either foreign operating systems or programs targeting the foreign operating systems on a different host operating system. Lastly, the UML project gives an idea of porting the Linux kernel to the userspace. This report also proposes two approaches, the first one is to perform emulation at the seL4 syscall API layer, and the second one is to provide seL4 kernel ABI layer. They all share similar goals but tackle the problem from different perspectives. An analysis in this report will reveal similarities and differences between those techniques. Evaluation approaches and applications will also be proposed at the end to demonstrate the underlying technical solutions and outcomes of this project.
