\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

The work of this thesis has been inspired by Prof. Gernot Heiser and Axel Heider who encourage
me to explore the scope of this project leading to an enhancement in research skills
and understanding of emulation technologies. Further support and
encouragement have been given by James Nakoda Nugraha who provides me the recommendation, advice, and information about Linux. At last, I would like
to thank you, my families and friends, who always support me.
